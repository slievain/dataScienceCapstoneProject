## Coursera - Data Science Specialization - Capstone Project

This repository contains the code and documentation of my work during this capstone project.  
It is the end part of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera by the Johns Hopkins University.

See the [Detailed Documentation section](#detailed-documentation) for in depth information on my work.

### Milestone Report

This report was written after a few days looking at the project. It describes the first initial phases:  
* Data Retrieval and Cleaning
* Exploratory Analysis
* Thoughts for a prediction model

See documentation [here](http://rpubs.com/slievain/254835)

### Data Product

A data product hosted on shinyapps.io was created to showcase my predictive model.

See the data product [here](https://slievain.shinyapps.io/data_science-capstone_project/)

### Slide Deck

This slide deck pitch my data product. It is meant for a non-technical audience.

It is constrained to be 5 slides or less and should:

* show off the app and how it works,
* explain how my model works,
* describe its predictive performance quantitatively.

### Detailed Documentation

Note that this document was not required but I felt it would bring more credit to my work.
